                    <p> Hi! Nice to see you here! My name is Lukrecija and I am currently studying Interactive Media at New York University in Abu Dhabi. I am passionate about design and technology and I love creating new things by combining both.</p>
                    <p>"Projects" page contains all of my work from my Interactive Media studies so far. I have explored visual and web design, as well as sound and video production. Nevertheless,  I still have a long way of learning ahead of me. </p>
                    <p>"Pictures" page showcases my photography work. Portrait photography has been my favourite area of exploration in this field, therefore most of my work is about other people. I find them quite fascinating . </p>
