                    <p> Hi! Nice to see you here. My name is Lukrecija and I am currently a student at New York University in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. I am majoring in Interactive Media with a minor in Computer Science. I am passionate about design and technology and I love creating new projects by combining both. </p>
                    <p>In my studies, I am gaining technical skills in design, programming, multimedia production and  engineering while considering the ethical and social implications of modern technologies and products. Not only that, but my university and its liberal arts curriculum also allows me to engage in a wide range of subjects, from languages to social sciences and mathematics, while at the same time offering many opportunities for travel. For instance, I am enrolled in a “Principles of Marketing” course in New York this June of 2023, planning to complete my Sophomore year spring semester in Buenos Aires, and my Junior year spring semester in New York.  </p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, my daily life consists of more than just my formal education.  I am a keen fan of sports, currently playing touch rugby and volleyball, and throwing in a few jogs from time to time. My other hobbies include photography and everything that involves crafting tangible things with my own hands, whether it would be knitting, jewelry making or simple sketching. </p>

<!-- "Projects" page contains all of my work from my Interactive Media studies so far. I have explored visual and web design, as well as sound and video production. Nevertheless,  I still have a long way of learning ahead of me -->
