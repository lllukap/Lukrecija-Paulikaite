                    <p>Since my personal website has been my biggest project so far, the Projects section is mainly centered around the creation and development of this website. First window showcases a prototype done in Figma, and the second window is a link to an initial wireframe that was done in Adobe XD . The website was coded completely from scratch and deployed on GitHub. </p>
                    <p> The last window shows a project that was completed for a “Communications Lab” course. It was a group project in which I was responsible for the development of the concept and the coding. It is a hand-drawn SVG map of Abu Dhabi that illustrates and provides video information about some of the main attractions in the city. The Barber Shop video was done by my group members, as well as the Dessert Sound Project. </p>
